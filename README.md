# Higher/Lower Game

#### _C#, .NET: Higher/Lower Game, 9/24/2019_

## Description
Create a Higher/Lower Game, console application that 'guesses' what number a user is thinking of.

## Application should have:
- Separate frontend and backend logic

- The app should ask the user to pick a number between 1-100.

- The app should then 'guess' a number and ask whether the user's number is higher or lower than the 'guessed' number.

- If the user says the number is lower, the program should guess a lower number. If the user says the number is higher, the program should guess a higher number.

- The game should go on until the program guesses the correct number.

- Alter the app so the computer 'picks' a random number and asks the user to guess it using the same higher/lower rules. The user should be able to pick which version of the game they would like to play.


## Example
- Program: Would you like to play the higher/lower game? (Yes/No)
- User: Yes.
- Program: Okay.
- Program: Is your number higher or lower than 50? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
- User: Lower
- Program: Is your number higher or lower than 25? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
- User: Higher
- Program: Is your number higher or lower than 33? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
- User: Higher
- Program: Is your number higher or lower than 42? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
- User: Higher
- Program: Is your number higher or lower than 46? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
- User: Lower
- Program: Is your number higher or lower than 44? (Higher/Lower/Correct)
- User: Correct
- Program: Great! I guessed your number. Would you like to play again? (Yes/No)
- User: No
